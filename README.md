### Introduction
Analyses of the Republic abound. The object of this sketch is not to follow all the windings of its ideas, but to indicate sufficiently their literary framework and setting. Socrates speaks in the first person, as in the Charmides and the Lysis. He relates to Critias, Timaeus, Hermocrates, and an unnamed fourth person, as we learn from the introduction of the Timaeus, a conversation which took place "yesterday" at the Peiraeus. The narrative falls on the day of the Lesser Panathenaea, and its scene, like that of the Timaeus, Proclus affirms to be the city or the Acropolis, a more suitable place, he thinks, for the quieter theme and the fit audience but few than the noisy seaport, apt symbol of Socrates' contention with the sophists. The Timaeus, composed some time later than the Republic, is by an afterthought represented as its sequel. And the Republic, Timaeus, and unfinished Critias constitute the first of the "trilogies" in which Aristophanes of Byzantium arranged the Platonic dialogues. The Timaeus accordingly opens with a brief recapitulation of the main political and social features of the Republic. But nothing can be inferred from the variations of this slight summary. The dramatic date of the dialogue is plausibly assigned by Boeckh to the year 411 or 410. Proof is impossible because Plato admits anachronisms in his dramas. Socrates tells how he went down to the Peiraeus to attend the new festival of the Thracian Artemis, Bendis/ and, turning homewards, was detained by a group of friends who took him to the house of Polemarchus, brother of the orator Lysias.
